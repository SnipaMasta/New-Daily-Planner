# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

My scheduler is for the working man/woman with a workday bursting at the seams! The application allows you to plan each day by the hour with custom to-do tasks and instantly be able to spot the hour of the day, as well as the date, with color-coded time blocks. With this project, I was able to further hone my "localStorage" skills as that is necessary to save the events the user types into the box. Not only that, but this project helped nail down how concretely useful, dynamic and practical JavaScript could be. Of course I already knew this, but something about seeing colors change as a result of JavaScript makes my brain happy for some reason.

## Installation

No installation required! Simply click the link to check out and use the workday scheduler! If you would like to save the event you type, simply click the 'save' button at the end of each box.
